# camera-calibration-supervisor

This README is a guide to use the [camera-calibration-supervisor
](https://github.com/robotology/camera-calibration-supervisor) for the ATIS cameras mounted on iCub. If you need more information just have a look to the original repo! 


The stereo calibration or the mono calibration allows obtaining intrinsic and extrinsic parameters removing distortions from the lenses. 
The camera-calibration-supervisor is a user-friendly framework that identifies the best chessboard poses guiding you into the next chessboard position. This set of positions are the best set to obtain a good calibration.

## How to set up your calibration on the robot ðŸ¤–

### Requirements
* Laptop with the installed camera-calibration-supervisor app: icub23
* Checkerboard-fast: SAMSUNG tablet
* iCub's eyes vergence ~ 5

Let's start with the calibration on the robot! 

* First of all you need to turn on the iCub's motors and CPU by clicking the buttons on the side of the iCub's backpack.
Then, run `yarpmanager` and run `icub-head`,`icub-zynq` & `icub-23/24`from the Cluster. 

* From Entities search for`iCubStartup-eventdriven` application and run:

  * `yarplogger` to check any error occurring using the robot. 
  * `yarprobotinterface` to run the robot. 
  * Do not forget to shift iCub's eyes vergence to ~ 5 (`yarpmotorgui` from the terminal, /head, JOINT5)

* From Entities search for `vViewCamCalibSupervisor` application, run and connect everything.


* From Entities search for `Event_Cam_Calib_Supervisor_App` application and run all the `yarpviews`. 
  * Then, from a terminal run `stereoCalib --from icubEyes_ATIS-board-gazebo.ini`. 
  * Finally, run `calibSupervisor` from the  `Event_Cam_Calib_Supervisor_App` application and connect everything. 
  
Please, make sure to check the .ini file. It should look like the one below:

```ruby

[STEREO_CALIBRATION_CONFIGURATION]
boardWidth 8
boardHeight 6
boardSize 0.021675
numberOfPairs 30
```

* Open a yarp rpc port: `yarp rpc /stereoCalib/cmd`  and type `start`. You should get something like this: 
```
>>start
Response: "Starting Calibration..."
```
This step should be handled by `stereoCalib`, but if you want to monitor the ongoing process I advise you to run `stereoCalib` from a terminal looking at what the application returns. 
* Now, your calibration is ready to start. Therefore, take your chessboard and put the `yarpviews` (/display, /viewleft and /viewright) visible whilst you are moving your board. The calibration process needs to collect several good positions for the board that is equal to the `numberOfPairs` of the .ini file. Please, be sure `stereoCalib` is collecting the images writing:  `[INFO] Saving images number #`
 
* Once you have collected all the positions is the time to obtain the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters running the script: 
```ruby
modify-params.sh icubEyes_ATIS-board-gazebo.ini outputCalib.ini cameraCalibration
```
This script will overwrite the results on the initial .ini file. You should obtain something like this: 
```ruby
Using file /home/icub/.local/share/yarp/robots/iCubGenova02/icubEyes_ATIS-board-gazebo.ini
stereoCalib writes the following file: /home/icub/.local/share/yarp/contexts/cameraCalibration/outputCalib.ini
 
Running script...with params /home/icub/.local/share/yarp/robots/iCubGenova02/icubEyes_ATIS-board-gazebo.ini /home/icub/.local/share/yarp/contexts/cameraCalibration/outputCalib.ini cameraCalibration
 
 
Script completed successfully...
```

* Let's now check our calibration! Run `Event_Calib_Cameras` and conenct everything. You now should be able to see the chessboard with no distortion!
